    background-color: #E6E6E6;
    // color: #A0A0A0;

### Packages: (located in package.json under 'dependencies')
    - react-router-dom
    - @material-ui/core

Changed background color of entire app by modifying index.css

### To center divs:
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <div style="display: inline-block"></div>
    </div>

### Positioning Absolute div inside another div
    Make the outer div 'position: relative' and the inner 'position: absolute'. Thereafter, 'top, bottom, left, right' will be designated to the outer div, and not the entire dom! Outer div's style must also be 'display: inline-block'

### Customizing theme with Material-UI
    YOU NEED TO IMPORT MuiThemeProvider and createMuiTheme specifically from '@material-ui/core/styles'

### Prevent phishing attempts from exploiting internal react vulnerability - anchor tags 
    include rel="noopener noreferrer" in anchor tags that have target="_blank"
    
### To run the react project only:
    Run command line from the client directory, run npm start

### Setup concurrent rules to run both node.js server and react project; the node.js server is not reay yet as of 03/13/19
    Run command line from root directory, run npm start

### Targeting a local rule via one jss element: $className
    cardMediaContainer: {
        display: 'relative', 
        overflow: 'hidden',
        '&:hover $cardMedia': {
            transform: 'scale(1.2)'
        }
  }

### React seems to automatically spread arrays of elements when returned.
