The same notion applies to using an app over using a desktop: why should someone use an app for a service that’s faster on the web via their desktop?\r\n              </Typography>\r\n              <Typography>\r\n              The point of your restaurant’s app should be to provide a faster and more convenient method than calling­in or using your website, which is a good introduction to the next point ­ user experience.\r\n              </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n              User Experience\r\n              <Typography variant=\"overline\">\r\n                \"How do I even place an order on this thing?\"\r\n              </Typography>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <Typography>\r\n                  31% reported that apps/mobile sites that are too difficult to navigate\r\n                  </Typography>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <Typography>\r\n                  28% responded that it is difficult to type personal information on small screen\r\n                  </Typography>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  <Typography>\r\n                  22% reported that the payment process was too complicated\r\n                  </Typography>\r\n                </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <Typography>\r\n              Overall, 46% of users agree that apps that are accessible and easier to navigate would make them more likely to complete a payment transaction. The more difficult it is to make a transaction, the less likely users are to convert into paying customers. Your intention should be to mitigate the number of hurdles facing users before they can complete transactions, and the gathered data above affirms this notion. \r\n              </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            Security concerns\r\n            <Typography variant=\"overline\">\r\n            “Their app doesn’t seem too official, I mean it’s very unresponsive and navigation isn’t user­friendly whatsoever...Maybe I downloaded the wrong app?”\r\n            </Typography>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <Typography>\r\n                  27% reported concerns around security of payment info\r\n                </Typography>\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <Typography>\r\n                  26% reported concerns around security of personal info\r\n                </Typography>\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <Typography>\r\n            Although security and comfort contributed least to users' decisions, you can see how both an app’s responsiveness and its ease­of­use contribute to a user’s expectations and their overall sense of trust with the app. During the Jumio 2013 survey, 51% of users that abandoned an online transaction did so because they felt “uncomfortable entering their credit card information.”\r\n            </Typography>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li><Typography>62% of respondents aged 55+ felt uncomfortable with the service they were using</Typography></li>\r\n              <li><Typography>59% of respondents aged 45­54</Typography></li>\r\n              <li><Typography>45% of respondents aged 18­34</Typography></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <Typography>\r\n            The ideal app should cater to and be easy­to­use for a sizable margin of users with a wide age group in mind.\r\n            </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(jssStyle)(Three_easy_ways_to_improve_your_restaurants_app)\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
