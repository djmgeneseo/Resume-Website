Design and Wireframing\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img3} className={classes.img} alt=\"Design and Wireframing graphic\"/>\r\n        <Typography>\r\n        Source: Interaction-Design\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        <strong>When designing an app, we focus less on developing the “right look” and more on achieving the “right feel.”</strong> Creating a desired experience will take time, so we tend to leave adequate amounts to ensure that every detail is taken into consideration. Designing an app is like mapping out a novel: typically, authors don’t just sit behind a keyboard and churn out their magnum opus based on whatever comes to mind. Before jumping into the process, <strong>you need time to organize your thoughts and determine how your content will be ordered and presented to the user.</strong> Wireframing is helpful for doing just that: developers can better determine how an app’s elements will both function and be oriented in relation to one another. The visual component of wireframing also helps to elicit more precise and critical input from the team, which is crucial to making an app feel “just right.”\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5'>\r\n        4. Coding (Development) and Beta Testing\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        What’s important isn’t how quickly an app is made, but rather how well and consistently it performs. Part of development includes extensive beta testing. <strong>Never assume that an app will work 100% of the time unless you’ve already proven so with ample amounts of evidence.</strong> An app that works only seven out of ten attempts will not sell more than an app that functions with higher consistency. That’s why we require all our clients to save time between an app’s launch date and its expected completion to search for any hidden errors or glitches that might impede on your user’s experience.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5'>\r\n        5. Marketing\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img4} className={classes.img} alt=\"Marketing diagram\"/>\r\n        <Typography>\r\n        Source: Clin-Edge\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        <strong>Pre-launch advertising is just as vital to an app’s success as post-launch marketing is.</strong> The objective of pre-launch marketing is to create anticipation for the release of your app. Conversely, the objective of post-launch is to direct user traffic towards your app via Search Engine Optimization (SEO). To ensure that your investments will yield profits, it’s best to start researching advertisement methods as early in development as possible instead of waiting right before the app’s launched.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\">\r\n            Here's a bare-bones guide we consider following:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Devise a well-timed launch date before coding the app</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Create a website and a landing page to promote the app during its development</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Research and deploy paid user acquisition strategies</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Advertise for and aggregate potential beta testers and users – collect their emails and notify them once the app nears its launch</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>After launch, use analytics to improve your app and listen to feedback to increase user retention rates</Typography></li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(jssStyle, {withTheme: true})(A_complete_overview_of_the_app_development_cycle)\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
