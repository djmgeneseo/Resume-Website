Focusing all efforts on a smaller audience will ensure that your app’s niche aligns with the majority of your audience’s interests; every user is valuable, and user loyalty is something that you need to work hard on in order to earn.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.blockQuote}>\r\n            “You have an app and you launched it only for a hundred people. But those hundred people are absolutely passionate about the product that you put out. They can't imagine a day without the app. If you can get it and drive that kind of passion from those users then rest assured those hundred people can get you the next thousand, the next ten thousand, or the next one million customers” <strong>­- The co-­founder of <ExternalLink url={`https://arkenea.com/`}>Arkenea</ExternalLink>, developer and author Rahul Varshneya</strong>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            In the words of successful author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss, do not underestimate the value of a true fan: work hard to build a fan­base of one or two thousand, and your app will grow from there. <strong>Your app’s ability to sell is contingent on meeting user expectations: if you cannot identify and meet the majority of your audience’s expectations, than your chances of making a profit are slim.</strong>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            4.\tWould I be competing against non­profit hobbyists?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            At the other extreme of niche­hunting, you’ll know if your app’s niche is too small if the competition is led by app developers who aren’t in it to make a profit. Although the niche may be too small to spark the interests of bigger start ups, <strong>niches that are dominated by developers with non­profit intentions are a lost cause.</strong> Even if your app has more to offer than the leading app does, users are more likely to download a free app that gets the job done.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            5.\tCan my app’s niche be scaled down?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            The most successful apps are intuitive, user friendly, and most of all innovative. <strong>Successful apps tend to compel and retain user interest by infusing a sense of nuance into an otherwise mundane task.</strong> Don’t over­pile your app’s UI with a half­-dozen extra functions that don’t serve its main purpose, especially for the sake of attracting a larger audience: chances are, several separate apps offer a more innovative approach to each one. <strong>Explore a singular niche on the appstore and figure out whether your idea puts a new and innovative spin on it that others do not.</strong> Avoid developing the swiss­army knife of applications ­- break its functionality down.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            If something about your app’s development triggers a new idea, set it aside for a future app­venture. The app industry is attracting a lot of start ups, so it’s wise to avoid pitting your app against hundreds of others in a highly competitive field. <Link underline='always' to={`/blogs/messapps/the-top-five-greatest-pitfalls-in-app-marketing`}>Read more about common marketing pitfalls.</Link>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(jssStyle, {withTheme: true})(TheSecretBehindAllSuccessfulAppsIsInUserLoyalty)"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
