Others might consider paid advertisements when user retainment rates hit below a comfortable threshold. Feedback is an invaluable asset when improving app’s ability to meet its users' interests. If hardly anyone hears about your app and you aren't receiving user feedback after a failed launch, then how can you discern whether poor marketing or poor development is to blame? If the app's user­friendliness is to blame, then how will the development team know which aspects of the app to improve? The earlier in development you can net in feedback, the more time you’ll have to work towards meeting user expectations. The function of user acquisition is double­folded: not only to increase monetization in the short­term, but also to provide a direction for your app to follow in the long­run.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\">\r\n            Q: Which services (Facebook ads, Google ads, twitter etc.) should I use to promote my app?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            A: Exactly where you should advertise depends on your budget, demographic, and overall expectations. Facebook and Twitter allow for shorter campaigns than most, and appds like <a href={'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adwords&hl=en'} rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adwords</a> can help you get the best out of each - so yes, Facebook and Twitter would be a great place to start.

Essentially, these are shortcuts that are more convenient than links are due to their ability to direct users straight to online content via an image­reader. Its invention is based off a simple e­marketing ethic: the easier it is for someone to seek your content, the more likely they are to access it. QR coding is especially convenient if you wish to expand your app's advertising onto the streets: if a pedestrian owns a QR reader app and a camera phone with which to take the picture with, then their already­installed QR readers will automatically send them to your website ­ no lengthy URL addresses required. \r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\">\r\n            Q: How big should my budget be?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A: Costs will obviously vary, but the complexity of the app in question is the main determinant. <a href=\"https://savvyapps.com/blog/how-much-does-app-cost-massive-review-pricing-budget-considerations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" >According to the founder and CEO of Savvy Apps Ken Yarmosh,</a> integrating back­end servers into your app will typically push the budget into a six­figure range, whereas simpler apps coded for a singular platform tend to cost below $35,000. Note that development costs are likely to increase rather than decrease over the course of an app’s lifetime, so expect your prospective budget­ceiling to rise.

Marketing is an investment in both time and resources: with trends leaning favorably towards those whom invest more in paid user acquisition strategies, it'd be wise to start performing marketing research early­on to distinguish the advertising that you can and cannot afford.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\">\r\n        Q: App Indexing seems too complicated to implement; why should I care?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A: Say that you have both an app and a dedicated website for it, yet your app has lower daily user acquisition rates than your website has daily visitors. With the development of deep linking for apps in 2015, Google can finally help solve this problem: now, when someone searches your website through google, a clickable thumbnail will appear right beside your website’s URL on the results page — <strong>your app will then have the same exposure as your website does.</strong> App Indexing is beneficial because it both re-engages inactive users with a simple Google search and can redirect potential users straight to your app’s installation page, eliminating the hurdles that would otherwise stand between website visitors and your app’s installation page.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        If your app is indexed through Google, every time a user clicks on your app's thumbnail, they'll be directed to your app’s installation page in the Play Store/App Store; if they have already have the app installed, then they'll be redirected to a predesignated screen on the app itself. In that way, App Indexing allows apps to receive the same exposure that websites get through ordinary search queries.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\">\r\n        Q: Do I really need a landing page?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A: Simply put: if you do not delegate resources for a website, then your app will be at a marketing deficit. <a href='https://www.apptamin.com/blog/create-your-apps-website-before-your-first-line-of-code/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Some have even argued that creating one should precede an app’s coding altogether.</a>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Without a website, your app won’t have access to the most recent and greatest breakthrough in app marketing – Google’s App Indexing. Search engine optimization both inside and outside the app store should be your primary focus for marketing, and losing the benefits of App Indexing will severely harm your chances for success. Additionally, dedicated websites act as a central hub for communication between potential users and app development teams; without one, users would have one less place to turn to for important information about your app – most notably its launch date. Developing a website for the sake of having a landing page is reason enough to do so: increasing promotions both before and after an app’s release will help shape your app’s identity online. Some useful tools and resources for all of your launch page’s needs are:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='https://unbounce.com/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unbounce Mobile App Template</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='https://www.wishpond.com/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wishpond</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blogger</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='https://wordpress.org/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='https://www.leadpages.net/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Leadpages</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='https://www.smore.com/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Smore</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph><a href='http://dopresskit.com/' rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Presskit</a></Typography>   \r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5'>\r\n        Q: How could app analytics help my app?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A: Out of the 1.5 million apps on the iOS App Store, only about a third have at least one review — the hard truth is, an app is either successful or it’s not. Yes, an app needs positive reviews to climb in the rankings; however, an app’s success doesn’t necessarily depend on positive feedback alone. Let’s say that your app does well at launch with just shy of one thousand downloads, yet it falls under the 66.6% of apps which have yet to receive a single review. Weeks pass by, and you’re left without any user input and nothing with which to help guide improvements to your app.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        How can you avoid this situation? <strong>By not relying wholly on reviews to guide your app’s success.</strong> Analytics provides a continuous flow of reliable, nonpartisan information. With the feedback gathered from app analytics, you’ll gain more insight on your app’s retainment rate, the different cohorts that comprise its user base, and the elements of your app which elicit the highest rate of conversion of potential consumers to actual users.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(jssStyle, {withTheme: true})(ElevenOfTheMostFrequentlyAskedAppMarketingQuestions)","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/styles'; // jss library\r\nimport {Typography} from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nimport img1 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/a-complete-overview-of-the-app-development-cycle/1.jpg';\r\nimport img2 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/a-complete-overview-of-the-app-development-cycle/2.jpg';\r\nimport img3 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/a-complete-overview-of-the-app-development-cycle/3.jpg';\r\nimport img4 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/a-complete-overview-of-the-app-development-cycle/4.jpg';\r\n\r\nconst jssStyle = theme => ({\r\n    img: {\r\n      display: 'block',\r\n      marginLeft: 'auto',\r\n      marginRight: 'auto',\r\n      marginBottom: '30px',\r\n      marginTop: '30px',\r\n      maxWidth: '90%'\r\n    },\r\n    blockQuote: {\r\n      background: '#f9f9f9',\r\n      borderLeft: '10px solid #ccc',\r\n      margin: '1.5em 10px !important',\r\n      padding: '0.5em 10px',\r\n      display: 'block',\r\n      quotes: `'\"''\"''\"''\"'`,\r\n      '&::before': {\r\n        color: '#ccc',\r\n        content: 'open-quote',\r\n        fontSize: '4em',\r\n        lineHeight: '0.1em',\r\n        marginRight: '0.25em',\r\n        verticalAlign: '-0.4em'\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    center: {\r\n        textAlign: 'center'\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst ACompleteOverviewOfTheAppDevelopmentCycle = (props) => {\r\n  const {classes} = props;\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            1.

Start by addressing the flaws in other yet similar app designs – <strong>turn their weaknesses into your strength.</strong>          \r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            2.

If you’re in need of a team, come discuss your idea with us and we’ll introduce you to some of our own: +1-646-741-4814. Conversely, say that you wanted to try your hand at coding yourself: we provide resources here on our website that are tailored to help guide the curious non-coder into the vast world of programming. Development is typically a longer process compared to the rest in an app’s development cycle, and learning to code competently enough to create an app would require an expensive investment of your time; the competition will only grow stronger in your stead, so weigh your priorities wisely. Although you could save money by coding alone, remember that the market’s competition is getting fiercer, and having a knowledgeable team on-board will ensure that your app functions as flawlessly as the other successful apps do.      \r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            3.

Designing an app is like mapping out a novel: typically, authors don’t just sit behind a keyboard and churn out their magnum opus based on whatever comes to mind. Before jumping into the process, <strong>you need time to organize your thoughts and determine how your content will be ordered and presented to the user.</strong> Wireframing is helpful for doing just that: developers can better determine how an app’s elements will both function and be oriented in relation to one another. The visual component of wireframing also helps to elicit more precise and critical input from the team, which is crucial to making an app feel “just right.”\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n        4. Coding (Development) and Beta Testing\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        What’s important isn’t how quickly an app is made, but rather how well and consistently it performs. Part of development includes extensive beta testing. <strong>Never assume that an app will work 100% of the time unless you’ve already proven so with ample amounts of evidence.</strong> An app that works only seven out of ten attempts will not sell more than an app that functions with higher consistency. That’s why we require all our clients to save time between an app’s launch date and its expected completion to search for any hidden errors or glitches that might impede on your user’s experience.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n        5.

To ensure that your investments will yield profits, it’s best to start researching advertisement methods as early in development as possible instead of waiting right before the app’s launched.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\r\n            Here's a bare-bones guide we consider following:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Devise a well-timed launch date before coding the app</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Create a website and a landing page to promote the app during its development</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Research and deploy paid user acquisition strategies</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>Advertise for and aggregate potential beta testers and users – collect their emails and notify them once the app nears its launch</Typography></li>\r\n            <li><Typography paragraph>After launch, use analytics to improve your app and listen to feedback to increase user retention rates</Typography></li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(jssStyle, {withTheme: true})(ACompleteOverviewOfTheAppDevelopmentCycle)\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/styles'; // jss library\r\nimport {Typography} from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nimport img1 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/1.jpg';\r\nimport img2 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/2.jpg';\r\nimport img3 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/3.jpg';\r\nimport img4 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/4.jpg';\r\nimport img5 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/5.jpg';\r\nimport img6 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/6.jpg';\r\nimport img7 from '../../../../assets/img/blogs/messapps/an-intro-into-testflight-external-testing/7.jpg';\r\n\r\nconst jssStyle = theme => ({\r\n    img: {\r\n      display: 'block',\r\n      marginLeft: 'auto',\r\n      marginRight: 'auto',\r\n      marginBottom: '30px',\r\n      marginTop: '30px',\r\n      maxWidth: '90%'\r\n    },\r\n    blockQuote: {\r\n      background: '#f9f9f9',\r\n      borderLeft: '10px solid #ccc',\r\n      margin: '1.5em 10px !important',\r\n      padding: '0.5em 10px',\r\n      display: 'block',\r\n      quotes: `'\"''\"''\"''\"'`,\r\n      '&::before': {\r\n        color: '#ccc',\r\n        content: 'open-quote',\r\n        fontSize: '4em',\r\n        lineHeight: '0.1em',\r\n        marginRight: '0.25em',\r\n        verticalAlign: '-0.4em'\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    center: {\r\n        textAlign: 'center'\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst AnIntroIntoTestflightExternalTesting = (props) => {\r\n  const {classes} = props;\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        There are two types of testing to review; internal (closed) and external (open).\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Last time, we reviewed the process of initiating Internal Testing; now, let’s focus on opening up your beta to <strong>External Users.</strong>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5' gutterBottom>\r\n            Prerequisites:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph>\r\n                    An iTunes Connect Record\r\n                </Typography>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n                <Typography paragraph>\r\n                    A pre-uploaded build of your app\r\n                </Typography>\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            Let's get into it!\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Login to your <strong>iTunes Connect</strong> page and select <strong>My Apps:</strong>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img1} className={classes.img} alt=\"Step 1\"/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Open the <strong>Activity</strong> tab on the upper-most pane and scroll down to select the build to be tested; select the proper <strong>Version</strong> and <strong>Build:</strong>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img2} className={classes.img} alt=\"Step 2a\"/>\r\n        <img src={img3} className={classes.img} alt=\"Step 2b\"/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Click Test Information and leave instructions for testers to follow in <strong>What to Test</strong>.

Analytics serves best when it’s utilized not only to improve an app’s marketing, but also its overall experience. With the information gathered from app analytics, developers can essentially hone in on the aspects of an app which users enjoy the most. Even if your app's launch is successful, user retention rates will inevitability decay. Passing judgments on your app's direction when retention rates dwindle would be difficult if your app reviews are bottlenecking from a general lack of user interest. App analytics offers a more precise, continuous, and objective stream of feedback about both your app's overall performance and its user base that is invaluable to those who wish to earn back user loyalty. Here is a random sampling of functions that analytic services such as <ExternalLink url=\"https://www.adjust.com/solutions/marketers-working-with-adjust/?utm_channel=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_term=mobile%20app%20tracking%20adjust&utm_content=form&utm_campaign=adjust_DT_US&_bt=190898160422&_bk=adjust&_bm=p&_bn=g&_bg=47197688292&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoInnBRDDARIsANBVyASmSrcLeW8ZOJiiZZs8M7Oo4MHVqQpja-pk2bmjscuT8jtCP6AQLVoaApb7EALw_wcB\">Adjust</ExternalLink> and App Analytics are currently offering:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}>Heat Mapping</Typography>\r\n        <img src={img1} className={classes.img} alt=\"App Analytics - Heat Mapping\"/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A feature that’s unique to App Analytics, heat mapping comes in handy while investigating how users interact with your app. A new feature to heat mapping is gesture recognition, which traces all touches and gestures including swipes, taps, rotations and pinches. Gesture recognition helps guide UI improvements in the right direction to ensure that the app will function and “feels” great based on popular user interactions.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4'>UI Suggestions</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A function that’s also unique to App Analytics, UI suggestions help developers by both detecting unresponsive gestures and by detecting screens which are causing confusion and therefore have the highest quit rates. It can even recognize which advertisements tend to be the viewed and generate the most revenue for your app.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n\r\n        <Typography variant='h4'>Conversion Funnels</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A conversion funnel is essentially a way to visualize e-commerce, or to better understand the process and rate by which browsing consumers are “converted” into paying users. Conversion funnels answer the question of “how many people are doing this after that?” and are formulated to help determine which of an app’s specific functions are aiding in the conversion rate of its users. Depicted in the funnel below; the more processes that are added, the more complex the funnel will be:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img2} className={classes.img} alt=\"Conversion Funnel illustration\"/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        While a limit on the number of processes isn’t necessary, the amount that are applied to a conversion funnel is not what matters; what matters is their relevance towards the app being analyzed. For instance; a simpler funnel that investigates the awareness (where customers are coming from?), interest (how is my app grabbing attention?), desires (which desires does your app fulfill? Which problems does it solve?), and purchase rates of potential users may suffice for a majority of apps on the market.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        The success of app analytics is measured by one’s ability to utilize the metrics – or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) – which are the most appropriate for the app in question.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        \r\n        <Typography className={classes.blockQuote}>\r\n        “Define metrics to mirror the desired behavior of your users: what is important for your app?” — Sylvain Gauchet of <ExternalLink url=\"apptamin.com\">Apptamin.com</ExternalLink>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n    \r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Here's a list that Dave McLure - founder of startup accelerator 500 Startups - suggests in <ExternalLink url=\"https://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/06/internet-market.html\">his post about the chief metrics</ExternalLink> that startups should focus on first:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img3} alt=\"illustration of the 5 types of measurements of user behavior\"/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        To become more acquainted with the paradigm of analytics, here are a few metrics that have a broader use across a range of different app categories:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n        DAU (Daily Active Users)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A cohort group for daily active users, DAU is a generic metric that helps track how potential users are reacting to major events – such as updates and device releases – that could have an impact on an app’s popularity.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n        MAU (Monthly Active Users)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography>\r\n        Another cohort group, monthly active users is useful for measuring the impact of long-term investments, such as those made towards paid user acquisition. Which marketing investments are the most effective in helping your app’s growth?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n            Usage and Retention Rate\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Retention is a major issue that all developers encounter eventually. That’s why an app’s overall success is contingent on both whether and for how long a developer can retain their users’ interest. Splitting the users into groups depending on when they installed your app and the events which enticed them to do so can lead to uncovering what aspects of your app is so appealing to newer users.An analysis of the variability in active users – from the cohort group of monthly active users (MAU) to the cohort of daily active users (DAU) – can also help determine how your user’s loyalty is faring against the trials of time.

A more in-depth investigation of your app’s audience will reveal the different groups of users which comprise your app’s demographic.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n            CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        CLTV is a metric used to determine how much each new customer is worth, or how much you can pay to acquire that customer. CLTV should be what forms your marketing budget, as its value is usually measured against the cost of customer acquisition. A helpful approach is to analyze the cohorts which comprise your user base and to trace how their values differ across each of the different cohorts – this should help reveal which users are either the most or the least valuable to you.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4'>\r\n        DARPU (Daily Average Revenue Per User)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        DARPU can also help determine the value of an individual user, which is usually based on the average amount of transactions they make from within the app itself.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n        Session Time\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        A metric for gauging the depth of a person’s relationship with an app, or how compelling the app is to its users.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n        App Launch / Load Time\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Your app’s average loading time across different users’ devices can impact the rate at which users uninstall your app and turn elsewhere.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h4\">\r\n        User Acquisition\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Are your paid advertisements improving sales?

Essentially, Google’s refined search engine will also include a thumbnail alongside all appropriate results that, when opened, will redirect the browsing user to a pre­ designated screen on your app. If the user does not own your app, then they will instead be redirected onto the app's installation page through the Play Store.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Indexing was exclusively available for the Android community until May 2015 when, under the pressure of increasing demand, Google’s team developed and released an API for the iOS platform. Google’s product manager even acknowledged the apparent advantages inherent in App Indexing in <ExternalLink url='https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/drive-app-installs-through-app-indexing.html'>a post on Google’s official blog.</ExternalLink>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography className={classes.blockQuote}>\r\n        “With the addition of these install links, we are starting to use App Indexing as a ranking signal for all users on Android, regardless of whether they have your app installed or not” — Product Manager at Google, Lawrence Chang\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Even though App Indexing has been free and available for both platform developers for over a year, <ExternalLink url='https://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/app-indexing-2016/'>only 30% of top ranking websites with an Android app and 19% with an iOS have made use of its benefits.</ExternalLink> By indexing your app with Google, you’ll be ahead of the marketing curve and better-equipped to contend with some of the highest ranking apps out there.

Deep links, however, are hyperlinks containing URLs which redirect the user to a particular location or piece of content on a website. The recent development of hyperlinking with apps, however, has allowed developers to redirect users straight to their app from their websites. By deep linking a user to a specific screen on their app, developers bypass the normal amount of input required by users to visit particular content on their app. Taking deep linking to another level, Google hybridized its search engine with app deep linking for the sake of re-engaging users with the previously installed yet forgotten apps on their devices.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Here’s the kicker: <strong>if a mobile user inserted a query into Google’s search engine and does not own the app yet clicks on its thumbnail anyway, a deep link to the Google Play store will send them to the app’s particular installation page through the Play Store/App Store instead.</strong> This is called deferred deep linking, and it’s extremely useful in that it helps both developers and Google by improving the Play Store’s traffic and increasing the amount of exposure that indexed apps receive.With another type of redirecting called contextual deep linking, developers can mine information about their users, including where they’re coming from and how they were ultimately converted from a potential user into an actual consumer. Developers use this to re-evaluate their marketing strategy, and to essentially get the most bang for their marketing buck.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>How to index your app with Google Search</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n        Getting an app indexed requires implementations into your app’s source code and your app’s own dedicated website for Google Search to reference.The process to acquire an index for your app is slightly complex; luckily, <ExternalLink url=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</ExternalLink> offers detailed instructions, and different SDKs such as <ExternalLink url=\"https://cocoapods.org\">CocoaPods</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink url=\"https://branch.io/\">Branch</ExternalLink> equip developers with necessary tools for free.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5' gutterBottom>1.

If you can open communication between you – the developer – and the user in a seamless fashion, you’d be putting yourself into an extremely advantageous position. <strong>Direct feedback is invaluable for making improvements to your app: consider offering expert analysis to requesting users, or some other form of advice that gives users an incentive to communicate with you.</strong> If you’re creative enough or the value of your communication warrants it, you can even charge users for this feature later in the app’s lifetime – advice can only be accessed by premium users, for instance.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph><strong>Leave users with an incentive to share your app.</strong> Offer rewards and services for users that share you app; services they'd otherwise need to pay for.

Cycling through quality content will give users a reason to re­engage with your app every so­often. If you cycle your content regularly, you’re assured to notice an increase in both user session length and user retention rates.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5' gutterBottom>3. Habit Support</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>Think of features that users will want to use on an everyday basis.

If your app can target a problem and fulfill its niche flawlessly, then it’ll naturally elicit daily user engagement, and those loyal users would feel as though they’d benefit from paying extra for that enhanced experience.</strong></Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5' gutterBottom>4. Gamification</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>It may require more time to develop, but consider adapting your app’s design with elements of competition. Have users compete against each other for bragging rights or award high­scorers with exclusive bonus content. <strong>As users try to earn higher scores, they’ll engage with your app more frequently

Why? Open betas allow any and all users to find and access your beta ­ no invite required. Of course, thinking ahead, Google set optional user restrictions so that developers can limit the allowed capacity of their beta tests, preventing floods of users from bursting over a server limits. Conversely, google permits developers to invite up to 40,000 Google+ users into their <strong>closed betas</strong> ­only those users with granted permission can find and access the app's page on the Play Store.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h5' gutterBottom> For iOS...</Typography>   \r\n        <Typography paragraph>The following year, Apple acquired and released Burstly’s beta testing services to the public.

To perform a closed beta, you’ll need to acquire trustworthy testers first.

Also, due to the tedious nature of assessment, it's possible to burn out a small set of testers. If you're having trouble finding newer and fresher candidates, one of the many benefits of beta testing services is their wealth of available testers.

The “higher” programming language that you choose ­(and there are many) is then translated from your source code into a “lower language.” This lower language is a form of input that your CPU can then register with the help of a compiler program.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>What's a Compiler?</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>A compiler is essentially the middle­man between you and the CPU that’s included in a Software Development Kit. It takes all of the source code that you've written in a higher language and transposes it into a stream of numbers that the CPU can then read ­ machine code. As a rule of thumb, a program is compiled before it's run.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>What's an SDK?</Typography>\r\n        <img src={img1} className={classes.img} alt='SDK illustration'/>\r\n        <Typography className={classes.center} paragraph>Source: <ExternalLink url={`Cometchat.com`}>Cometchat.com</ExternalLink></Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>SDK stands for \"Software Deveopment Kit,\" which is exactly what it sounds like: a package or \"toolkit\" of software that a programmer uses to create programs. This kit usually comes with an integrated programming language. Each kit contains compilers, debuggers, and any other facilities needed to develop apps for a specific platform. For the most part, it's highly uncommon to simply code using an SDK; it’s typically coupled with something called an Integrated Development Environment.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>What's an IDE?</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment that contains an SDK. Most IDEs are tailored to function around a particular SDK. An IDE’s purpose is to make coding with an SDK more manageable. What an IDE is to a programmer is essentially what an instrument is to a musician: although all instruments can play music, certain instruments allow a musician to express him or herself through a more desired/preferred format. Although all IDEs can be used while coding, one IDE and its included SDK might be preferred or even necessary for creating a program that is only compatible with a particular platform.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>Android and iOS IDEs</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}><strong><ExternalLink url={`https://developer.android.com/docs/`}>Android Studio</ExternalLink></strong></Typography>\r\n        <img src={img2} className={classes.img} alt='Android Studio interface screenshot'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}><strong><ExternalLink url={`https://developer.apple.com/xcode/`}>Xcode</ExternalLink></strong></Typography>\r\n        <img src={img3} className={classes.img} alt='Xcode interface screenshot'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>Java, Swift, and Objective-­C are both programming languages used for coding Android and iOS apps respectively. Developers interested in developing apps for iOS devices should first familiarize themselves with the IDE called Xcode, which uses the iOS ­compatible language of Objective­-C and Swift. As for Android devices, Eclipse and Android Studio are both the go­to IDEs for coding in the Android­ compatible language of Java. This also means that Android devices cannot run apps that are coded in Objective­C and Swift, and an iOS device cannot run apps that are coded in Java. There are, however, a few up­and­coming IDEs which are considered cross­platform compatible, such as Xamarin.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>What is HTML and CSS?</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>Both HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are programming languages that function in website development. HTML is used to structure a website with links, images, texts, videos and other “elements”; CSS is used in tandem with HTML to further stylize the layout of the webpage by re­arranging the colors, fonts, and positioning of HTML elements.</Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>What are the three main control structures of programming?</Typography>\r\n        \r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    <strong>Sequential Execution:</strong> Instructions in your source code that are compiled and executed in the same order as they appear. When ending a line of code, instead of using a ‘period’ mark like you normally might in English, you’ll be using a semicolon. After each semicolon, it is standard procedure to start the next instruction one line away from where the previous line ended. Check out the image below and notice how each instruction that's ended with a semicolon is followed by another on the next line. The instruction on line 57 begins at “font­family” and ends at the next semicolon, and a new instruction is created on line 58 in a similar fashion.\r\n                    <img src={img4} className={classes.img} alt='CSS demonstration of key-value pairs'/>\r\n                    <p className={classes.center}>*Written in CSS</p>\r\n                    Some Languages don't assign the semicolon with this purpose, such as HTML and Python, but most do: Xcode, C++, Java, CSS, etc.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    <strong>Conditional Statements:</strong> A more specialized instruction, known informally as the “if­-then” statement: <strong>if</strong> a certainconditionis met, <strong>then</strong> the included set of provided instructions will follow. In the image below, the phrase between the first parenthesis “(denom == 0 || num == 0)” is the conditional statement which, in this case, is testing whether or not the variable “denom” or the variable “num” is holding a value that is equal to 0. If it is, then the instruction below the conditional statement which is positioned between the two brackets are run, and the two variables are, again, set to the value of 0.\r\n                    <img src={img5} className={classes.img} alt='C++ demonstration of an \"if\" statement'/>\r\n                    <p className={classes.center}>*Written in C++</p>\r\n                    Note: variables are assigned in C++ like so: \"int denom = 0\". \"int\" designates the variable \"denom\" as an integer, and \"= 0\" sets the variable \"denom\"'s value to 0. The variable can be changed at any time once it's created by typing the variable's name and resetting its value, such as the conditional statement does above: \"denom = 0;\".\r\n                </li>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    <strong>Looping:</strong> Another specialized instruction, a looping statement is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until the specified condition is met. In the image below, the conditional statement is checking if the value inside of the variable ‘i’ is less than the value inside the variable ‘n.’ For every time the condition is NOT met, the loop will continue to repeat itself, starting with the conditional statement. That is, until the value inside of the variable “i” is greater than the value inside the variable ‘n’ ('n' is given a value at an earlier line in the source code), the loop will continue to run, and the instruction enclosed in brackets `cout .. a[i] .. \" \";` (which displays a number into a seperate console window) will run once every time the loop’s condition is NOT satisfied. The phrase “i++” means that the value inside of the variable “i” is being increased by one whole integer each time the loop is run. Eventually, the value of the variable “i” will be greater than that of the variable “n,” and the instruction listed between the brackets will stop being triggered.\r\n                    <img src={img6} className={classes.img} alt='C++ demonstration of a for loop'/>\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>What is a Queue vs a Stack (FIFO vs LIFO)?</Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>Both queues and stacks are ordered arrays (lists), meaning that the order of their contained variables is significant.

The \"apps downloaded\" statistic does not take into account the disproportionate averages of free­to­paid app downloads globally.

Although the niche may be too small to spark the interests of bigger start ups, <strong>niches that are dominated by developers with non­profit intentions are a lost cause.</strong> Even if your app has more to offer than the leading app does, users are more likely to download a free app that gets the job done.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            5.\tCan my app’s niche be scaled down?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            The most successful apps are intuitive, user friendly, and most of all innovative. <strong>Successful apps tend to compel and retain user interest by infusing a sense of nuance into an otherwise mundane task.</strong> Don’t over­pile your app’s UI with a half­-dozen extra functions that don’t serve its main purpose, especially for the sake of attracting a larger audience: chances are, several separate apps offer a more innovative approach to each one. <strong>Explore a singular niche on the appstore and figure out whether your idea puts a new and innovative spin on it that others do not.</strong> Avoid developing the swiss­army knife of applications ­- break its functionality down.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            If something about your app’s development triggers a new idea, set it aside for a future app­venture.

If you feel as though you’ve lost a grasp on what makes your app unique, stop and ask yourself:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>How can users benefit from using my app?</li>\r\n                <li>How does my app compare to and contrast with my competition's?</li>\r\n                <li>If I were browsing the app store today, which features would set my app apart from the rest?</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            The majority of your marketing efforts should be centered around how you will provide the answers to these above questions. If you plan on delegating all marketing responsibilities to a team, avoid the mistake of assuming that each individual is already on­board with the app's selling point.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            <strong>\r\n                The success of an app depends on its popularity, which is largely contingent on how it's being marketed: the marketing team’s collective understanding of your app’s selling point is as vital to your app’s success as the selling point itself.\r\n            </strong>\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            2.\tUnfamiliarity with the market's evolving stratagem        \r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            The common denominator between the most successful apps today concerns App store Search Optimization. ASO refers to the technique of choosing and incorporating specific keywords into an app description/name to generate the most visits from App Store search queries.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            The central ASO trend seems to be gravitating towards the incorporation of simplified phrasing and keywords within the app's description and title. The image below contains the top apps from Google Play Store’s Health & Fitness app category. Each of their names briefly yet concisely reflects their function:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img1} className={classes.img} alt='Top four Health and Fitness apps'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Notice how the two pedometer apps are simply named “Pedometer.”\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Before you publish your app, ask yourself: which keywords would a typical user search with to find an app like mine?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            3.\tNeglecting feedback     \r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Neglecting feedback is one of the most irresponsible things an appreneur can do. While marketing, your goal should be to improve communication between you, the developer, and the user. How big of an impact on an app's reviews does opening channels of communication have?\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Note the contrasting levels of effort invested in bolstering user­developer communication between the apps <strong>SoundCloud</strong> and <strong>Yik Yak</strong>:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img2} className={classes.img} alt='SoundCloud side-menu screenshot'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}>\r\n            <strong>SoundCloud</strong> (version 2016.05.04-­release)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img3} className={classes.img} alt='Yik Yak side-menu screenshot'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}>\r\n            <strong>Yik Yak</strong> (version 3.4.0)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Unlike SoundCloud, <strong>notice how Yik Yak's developers implemented a review and feedback feature directly into their UI.</strong> The results were on par with what we expected:\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img4} className={classes.img} alt='SoundCloud total reviews versus installs'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}>\r\n            <strong>SoundCloud:</strong> .88% of users left a review (assuming 250 million installs)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <img src={img5} className={classes.img} alt='Yik Yak total reviews versus installs'/>\r\n        <Typography paragraph className={classes.center}>\r\n            <strong>Yik Yak:</strong> 2.48% of users left a review (assuming 2.5 million installs)\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Although more users installed SoundCloud, <strong>approximately 3 times as many users left a review for Yik Yak</strong> (relative to each of the app’s installations). <strong>Fulfilling the demands of your current user base improves your application’s chances for success: your app is more likely to gain traction after it meets the interests of its user base.</strong> Better products equals better reviews, and having better reviews leaves an overall better impression on your app for potential users to see.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            4.\tLaunching apps with poor timing\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            Setting and promoting a release date is a great way to build anticipation; however, be sure to leave adequate time for beta testing before the app's launch. <strong>If you release the app too soon, there’s a good chance that it'll contain either unattractive glitches or experience­-breaking errors ­- overlooked glitches and bugs will put a strain on any app’s reputation.</strong> Even if the errors are addressed and fixed, the disproportionate ratio of negative to positive reviews will likely bottleneck the potential of your app’s success, making it unattractive and that much more difficult to market.\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            <strong>Also, try not to overlap your app’s release date with that of another highly anticipated app or tech.</strong> There's no risk in planning your app’s release for a later date; there is, however, a risk in endangering the success of your app by sharing its launch date with that of another anticipated product. \r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant='h4' gutterBottom>\r\n            5.\tCreating false expectations\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography paragraph>\r\n            <strong>Market your app in a way that neither sails over nor falls short of its intended functionality.</strong> When marketing and developing, stay focused on your app’s selling point.
